Requirements:
    Draw data from an open source weather API 
        Should be able to interchange our API key without our code being dependent on just one
    Able to take a zipcode input and present a radar image that autorefreshes every few minutes
    Stretch goal:
        Presented image switches between radar and textual forecast

General Goal:
    Able to display an image that comes from an API that can periodically refresh
        Can be used for stocks, sports scores, airline tickets, etc.


Code in Python with maybe some Javascript


Potential APIs:
    OpenWeather:
        https://openweathermap.org/api/weathermaps - radar
        https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#zip  - information
        # radar api : http://maps.openweathermap.org/maps/2.0/weather/PR0/4/5/5?appid=1f32df32063a31f7b1a4b4fd9adeefd7
# weather api : http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=78746,us&appid=1f32df32063a31f7b1a4b4fd9adeefd7


Timeline:
    Finding which API url to paste into code 
        Fix API key validation from server - 2 hours
        Sending a general request to the API to test functionality - 1 hour

    Validating zipcode (perhaps through design requirements or database)
        Digit requirement - 1 hour
        Number of characters requirement - <1 hour

    Parsing or converting data into temporary stored variables - 1 day -- only necessary if JSON isn't readable
        Converting JSON tags into key-value dictionary pairs - 2 hours


    Designing a page to present the radar or information - 2-3 days
        Perhaps just presenting retrieved image - 3 hours   
            open image locally and then use it as a source
        If getting information, taking the information and putting it into a basic HTML formatted page to make sense - 2 hours


    Having the API be retrieved periodically after being initialized for a zipcode - 3 days
       Making a basic timer and testing it - 2 hours
       Retrieving new image or data from API based on timer = needs to be dependent on availability of API data - 2 hours
       Asserting that the data is being refreshed periodically and not stagnating by comparing specific values returned by API call - 1 hour

    
Goals:
Neatify data without coupling to api
Add radar to page - parameters?

Time zone input
Sunrise and sunset
Kelvin to fahrenheit
